# Dog Feeding Timer

## Background

My girlfriend has a cute little dog and an obsession with novelty feeding devices, aka enrichment feeding toys. There are many of them spread all around the house and it was only a matter of time until she needed an automated food timer.

What a great opportunity to make good use of a Microcontroller to make a (hopefully) cheaper custom feeder, instead of buying yet another commercial product.

## Challenges

- Storing and releasing larger food items like Kongs, as well as small kibbles is a mechanical challenge.

- Translating an electrical signal to some kind of latch or rotator to dispense food

- Creating an easy to use UI with display

- Separate voltage power delivery for the micro controller and the mechanics
